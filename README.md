# CameraLocalisationTestBed
This is a project I created using ROS, OpenCv and Gazebo to test one's 3D localisation algorithms on live camera feed or videos.

You can watch the implementation and results of my algorithm for camera localisation in this video (apologies for the bad quality and shaking): https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-eyHIqgznDnZWlxUzZtWU5OUXM


It is giving fairly good resuls for 3D reconstruction too (will upload that video and code shortly...)
